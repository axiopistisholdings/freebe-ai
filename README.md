# Freebe AI

Freebe is an independent AI project focused on building practical, accessible AI systems and tools.

The project is designed for individuals and small teams working directly with AI — experimenting, learning, and building in real environments rather than controlled demos or closed platforms.

Freebe emphasizes simplicity, transparency, and real-world use over scale or competition.

## Freebe Chat

Freebe Chat is the public AI interface of the Freebe project.

It is a free AI workspace that allows users to think, search, and create in one place. Freebe Chat combines conversational AI, web search, and image generation in a simple, open environment intended for everyday use.

Freebe Chat is intentionally lightweight and accessible. It is not a development platform, automation system, or productivity suite. It exists as a public expression of Freebe’s AI systems and philosophy.

## Partnerships

Freebe is open to collaboration with independent AI developers and small teams.

Partnerships focus on real-world usage of AI models or services through API-based integration. The goal is practical use, meaningful feedback, and mutual support between independent builders.

Freebe does not host or operate AI models on its own hardware. All collaborations are API-based and rely on access provided by the model or service developer.
